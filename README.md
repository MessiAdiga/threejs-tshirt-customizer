This is a 3D SaaS website created using Three.js and AI features.
It utilizes Three.js's models, camera, ligthing and shadow features to provide a model of a T-shirt which the users can modify (https://threejs.org/).
It also utilizes OpenAI's DALL.E 2, which is n AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. (https://openai.com/dall-e-2).
Users can modify the color of the t-shirt using the color-picker, upload their own images to form a logo or use it as a full texture on the t-shirt as well as ask AI to generate logos or textures using simple prompts.
When trying out this project on your local machine, make sure to update your .env file with your own openAI account's api key.
To try it out locally, simply clone the project on your local.
